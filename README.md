The Darling Content Management System (Darling CMS) was created by Sevi Donnelly Foreman.
Official development began on 01/22/2017. The Darling Cms is a work of love.

The Darling CMS aims to provide a flexible web development architecture built on a solid set of
core components that serve to aide in development process without assuming to much about implementation.

Through custom apps and themes developers will be able to extend and style the Darling CMS however they like.

The core API defines interfaces, abstract classes, and concrete classes designed to aide in the development of
apps and themes. 

The Darling CMS aims to be standards compliant, and to provide a core whose code is simple and S.O.L.I.D.
in design.

At this moment there is not a stable release. The following development versions are available:

darlingCms_0.0_dev: This version is the first draft of the Darling Cms. The core is stable, though in need of 
                    some major refactoring. The overall logic is still clunky, and in some places overly complex,
                    and the doc comments are either incomplete, missing, or in need of major revision.
                    
darlingCms_0.1_dev: This is the current development branch of the Darling Cms. It is a major refactor of version 
                    darlingCms_0.0_dev. The goal is to reduce the overall complexity and clunkiness, and to add
                    clear documentation throughout core. When complete, this version will be more in line with
                    S.O.L.I.D design principals, and therefore easier to maintain.
